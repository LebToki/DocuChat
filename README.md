pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Simplified Steps

### Backend

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
# Install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Download the necessary models by running:

```sh
python backend/download_models.py
```
# Run the Flask app:

```sh
python backend/app.py
```
# Frontend
Ensure you have a local server setup (e.g., XAMPP, Laragon).

Place the PHP files in the appropriate directory of your server.
Open the project in your browser.

# Usage
- Upload documents through the frontend interface.
- Ask questions related to the uploaded documents.
- The backend will process the documents, generate embeddings, and provide relevant responses based on the content.
